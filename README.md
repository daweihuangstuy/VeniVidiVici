Repository for APCS1 Final Project

Brief project introduction
	For our final project we would like to create a terminal simulation of a classic game called “risk”.
This is a multiplayer world-domination conquest game that can support the participation of 2 - 6 players.
The number of troops that each player will receive at the start of the game is contingent on the number of
players at the start of the game. Everyone receives 20 troops if there are 6 players, 25 troops if there
are 5 players, 30 troops for 4 players, etc. There will be a total of 42 territories distributed over seven
continents. The player cannot visualize troop numbers in enemy territory but can see which territory is
occupied and by which enemy army. 

Launch instruction
	First you open the terminal. Then you have to enlarge the width of the terminal, we suggest 1000, so 
that you can have a better view of the map. After that you just follow the instructions about how you should
play the game. There is also instruction about whose turn is now. So it is really easy to play.XS
