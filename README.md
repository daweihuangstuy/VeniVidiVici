Instructions:


First, open terminal and enlarge your terminal window to a size big enough to be able to view the entire world map
(we suggest 1000) 
    	
To begin the game, type

   javac Woo.java

followed by

   java Woo

After the game begins and it is your turn, you have the option of using your troops to attack enemy territory,
or moving your troops to a different territory. Follow the prompts that appear in the terminal window.

To attack, type

   
   
To move troops, type




Rules:

You can use the attack command as many times as you want, but you can only use a maximum of 3 troops during each attack. 
You should also keep in mind that you will need to have at least 1 troop stay in your original territory so that you maintain ownership of that territory. 
For each troop used to attack, the computer will roll a dice to determine the winner of the attack. 
If the offense wins (the person who initiated the attack), the defense's total number of troops will decrease by one.
If the defense wins, the offense's total number of troops will decrease by one.
If you decide to attack an empty territory, or a territory with no troops occupying it, you will automatically gain ownership of that territory.
You also have the option to move your troops when it is your turn. You can only move troops to a territory that
you already occupy. 
So, for example, you CANNOT move your troops to a territory occupied by the enemy army.

Whoever conquers the set percentage of territories the players agreed to at the start of the game will be declared the winner!


About the game:

	Our final project is a terminal simulation of the classic game “risk”.
This is a multiplayer world-domination conquest game that can support the participation of 2 - 6 players.
The number of troops that each player will receive at the start of the game depends on the number of
players at the start of the game. Everyone receives 20 troops if there are 6 players, 25 troops if there
are 5 players, 30 troops for 4 players, and so on. There is a total of 42 territories distributed over seven
continents. The player can view troop numbers in enemy territory and know which territories are occupied by enemy armies. 
	On the map we have created, each territory will have an unique lable. Once a player has occupied a
territory, the color of the lable will change to correspond with the player's color. Since the game can sometimes last
too long, at the initial set up of the game, players can decide to only play up to the point where a certain percentage
of the total territories is occupied by one player, and that player would be declared the winner.
