/////////// Zone of Reflection \\\\\\\\\\\
------------------------------------------
OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- import a map from other filex
- map with color
- attack only the connected territories
- take turn between players to play
- updating the status and color on map

wow we so BOSS bc...

UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- during attack, you might pick a territory
that is surrounded by your territories, so 
you actually can't attack anyone and stuck
at there.

- this is not really a issue, but you cannot
move your troops from 1 place to another even
though it is connected by your territories.
This means that it will take you more time to
do the moving. That you have move them from one
territory to another territory that is connected.

blah blah pesky bug...
maybe some of these will move into the Obs.Ovrcm section...

COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- how to add color in terminal
- how to import a map into terminal

wow! oo!...

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- we changed table to map because this is 
much more cooler and it is easier to follow

- we changed the saving place of territories
from classes to a single 2-D array because
this is much more efficient

- we didn't follow the way of attack exactly
from the wikipedia because it is just too
much work and it didn't worth the time.

- we have to give up on inSurround because 
this didn't worth the time, even though you
might get stuck becaus of that

LESSONS LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- we learned that everything is not going
to work well. That thinking it in mind is
easy, but it is hard to tranfer our ideas
into codes. So we were forced to give up
some features.

tales of wisdom gained...
